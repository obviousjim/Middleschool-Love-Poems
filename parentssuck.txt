Leave me alone
Let me live my life
Nightmares 31 lines, a few comments, 7 years ago
I lay down to go to sleep 
All I can think of is you
Leave me alone
Let me live my life
I'm away at school and you can't take it
Don't control other's kids
Let them live their lives
Things will happen when they can happen
Just leave it alone
You say that I'm being walked on
I feel as if by you
Just let me play things out the way they need to be
I'll get the money when I can and it doesn't concern you
You've sheltered me my whole life
I'm trying to learn to live on my own
I can't do that if you are controling me still 
Just leave me alone
