As i looked into his eyes 
and found his longing stare
i stopped myself from saying words that showed how much i care
i put my hands up to his face
to hold my feelings in
i wouldn't say the words again
to show my love for him
the last time i had told him
how much he ment to me
he put my hands away from his
and said to leave him be
i never spoke the words again 
for fear of his deep fright
i thought it was the last time 
untill that blissful night
his fingers traced around my face
pushing hair away
and i was quite unprepared
for he was to say
my heart beat quickly. my head raced on
i thought that i might cry 
he looked at me if he might faint 
imagine this strong guy
but never would be more impressed 
with anything he'd do 
than when he took that heartfelt leap
and told me"i love you"
