Middle School love Its a silly thing They say kids dont know Its just a thing  Love is so different You know it  No matter what age It just doesnt fit  Love is what you find Over a period of time Its nothing in the street You cant buy it with a dime  My love for you Grows everyday You may not see it But it causes a delay  A delay in my heart A moment thinking It could be you and I Thats embracing  Middle School love A silly thing you know Its always different Somehow wacko.
