We met as merely words upon a screen,
Disembodied souls who found a mate
Through mind alone, and unsuspected yearning.

We fell in love the best way, sight unseen,
Pure hunger that nor feast nor flesh could sate,
Two hidden flames fair fed by phrases burning.

Most find their way by sight into the heart,
Loving first what must most quickly change
And only then what will the years endure.

We did the opposite, though not by art,
Taking steps that we did not arrange
Along a path both passionate and sure.
